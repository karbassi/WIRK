WIRK
====

WIRK is an IRC client created in Qt using C++.  It uses code from the [Communi IRC Framework](https://github.com/communi/communi) to manage the actual connections to IRC.

Getting it to run:

1. Install QT from http://qt-project.org/downloads
2. If you are on Windows and want to connect to an IRC server using SSL, you will need to download the appropriate Windows OpenSSL Library from http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
3. Open the .pro file in QT Creator
4. When it asks where to place the resulting builds, you can just press "Configure Project" to use the default paths
5. Press the big green play button in the lower-left
